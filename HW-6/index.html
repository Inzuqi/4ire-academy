                        <p>In rural Texas, welder and hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the remains of
                        several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone violently
                        wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the
                        two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton
                        Chigurh (Javier Bardem), on his trail. As Moss desperately attempts to keep one step
                        ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him with relentlessly growing
                        intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the laconic Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee
                        Jones) blithely oversees the investigation.</p>
